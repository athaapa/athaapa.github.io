My name is Ayush Thapa, and I'm a university student studying computer science. My hobbies include playing video games, listening to music, reading books, and learning new technologies.

This blog is mainly for me to build in public. I write about what I'm building, technical challenges I hit, and things I'm learning about startups and engineering.
